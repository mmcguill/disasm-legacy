1.	Imports now slightly wrong. Because of reverse import name lookup 
	when an exe imports by ordinal, the gui says import by name when 
	its actually imported by ordinal, this is because it sees the 
	function has a name. Fix.
	 
2.	TLB import / symbols not working.

3. Tab / Shift + Tab in textview doesn't move to next column
